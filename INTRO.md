# Welcome

Thank you for stopping by! This is the beginning of my data science journey.  I am proud to be an accomplished pharmacist with many years for caring for patients from all different walks from life but I am now transitioning into a way to help patients, customers or even just humans on a potentially more global scale.  I hope as I build my portfolio and gain experience that I will continue to hold on to the reason why I started this, to truly make a difference even in some small way.
